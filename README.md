# Sensor_fault_detection
This project centers on the Air Pressure System (APS), which generates pressurized air for various truck functions, including braking and gear shifting. The positive class in the dataset corresponds to failures of a particular APS component, whereas the negative class includes failures of components unrelated to the APS.
